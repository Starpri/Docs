# Getting Started

Our social media module allows you to send real-time notifications to your community whenever you go live to play games on Twitch, upload a new video to YouTube, send a tweet, or post anything on Instagram to stay in touch with them. You may easily inform every member about your most recent content updates with Starpri.To make sure you never miss their updates, you can also utilise the Starpri Discord bot to subscribe to additional content creators of your choosing. Keep yourself informed so you can play games with them or just relax and watch them interact!

All supported media sources are listed [here](/docs/social-media/sources)
